# LangChain-Chatbot/RagBot
Ragbot created using Langchain,Chroma db, groq_api and Django to converse with documents(currently supports only pdfs) in the docs folder.<br />
The docs folder needs to be added along with .env file containing GROQ api key.<br />
Lchain is the venv folder.<br />
LchainBot is the Django project.<br />
Notebook.ipynb was created for testing logic before implementation in Django project.<br />
To run install all required packages and run django server.<br />
The screen shot below is how it looks when the server is running. The program is aware of the context and the previous questions asked as seen from the last question.<br\> 
Question 1 was asked as a control before the server starts to check if it runs without any issue, hence we do not see that question in the screenshot<br\>
